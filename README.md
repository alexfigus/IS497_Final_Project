# Why I'm Doing This Cryptocurrency Project
Cryptocurrencies are a major topic in various social media sites, news articals, and financial organizations across the globe. I personally do not have any experience or knowledge about the current conversations about crypto but, I believe this analysis and review of the data set could help me build on my knowledge and hopefully provide strong questions for a bigger project. Through this project, I will provide detailed processes that explain how and where I collected the data, how to clean it up, the analyzation, and the plans for a bigger project.
