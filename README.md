# Why I'm Doing This Cryptocurrency Project
Cryptocurrencies are a major topic in various social media sites, news articals, and financial organizations across the globe. I personally do not have any experience or knowledge about the current conversations about crypto but, I believe this analysis and review of the data set could help me build on my knowledge and hopefully provide strong questions for a bigger project. Through this project, I will provide detailed processes that explain how and where I collected the data, how to clean it up, the analyzation, and the plans for a bigger project.

# Step 1: Collect The Data
Next step is to retrieve the dataset from the source I used. In the data folder, you will find more details about where I retrieved the datasets and the transformations I used to perform the analysis. I'm not experienced working and cleaning major datasets, so I believe this dataset provides a great start for other users to analyze and work with data visualizations.

# Step 2: Open Refine
This step takes the retrieve raw datasets and transforms the CSV files into a singular dataset. I will provide a link to OpenRefine's "How to Page" to help users determine their computer's compatibility and access to this resource. Once the user has access to this software, the first step is to import and select all 23 crypto CSV files. This provides the software with the required datasets it needs to revise. Once the datasets are uploaded, the user must press the "Configure Parsing Option" button to continue revising the CSV file for their preferences. The next step is to Create the Project by pressing the top right button. After the project is created, the user can remove the columns that are not necessary to the analysis. The ones I determined were not necessary to the analysis were columns "File" and "SNo." Once those edits are made, the user can export the file as a comma-separated value (CSV).

# Step 3: Jupyter Notebook
The last step of the datset is to analyze and visualize the cryptocurrencies. The notebook will provide a detailed description of the steps needed to make the numerous graphs. This step is important because there are numerous methods that users can perform to research other parts of the dataset. More information will be provided in the python folder.

# Future For Larger Project
My hope for the future of this project would be to analyze more of the columns and compare their results with my stated hypothesis. The hypothesis I came up with this project is older cryptocurrencies have a higher market value because they were able to reach the audience first. As stated in the Jupyter Notebook, the analysis shows that the two oldestt Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Dogecoin, had high marketcaps compared to their new crypto counterparts. These two coins support my claim but I believe more evidence is needed to support it. I would also like to review other datasets from Twitter because these coins are not protected by government organizations such as the SEC. This means users can manipulate their value and take advantage of these fragile markets.
