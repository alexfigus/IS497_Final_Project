# Raw Datasets
The first step of the process is to download the CSV list. Author is Sudalai Rajkumar. He is a major contributor to the Kaggle community and provides quality data sets for analysts and researchers. This dataset is about the financial history of 23 cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Depending on their time and value, the crypto currency provides the user with opening and closing values. There are other columns such as marketcap and volume which could help the user determine the economic value of each coin. It This list of CSVs was retrieved from Kaggle. A proper citation will be presented in the references folder.

# Revised Dataset
This section presents the revised version of all 23 CSV files. I merged them all into a singular dataset. I removed the columns "File" and "SNo" from my CSV file because I believe they would provide little analysis to the dataset. You will find the results of the revision in the folder below raw datasets.
